# Election_Analysis
Module 3, Python
## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

The purpose of the analysis of the electoral audit is, through the python tool, to develop a code that allows to automate the process of auditing not only congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and elections.
* Total number of votes cast
* Total number of votes for each candidate
* Percentage of votes of votes for each candidate
* The winner of the election according to the popular vote


## Election-Audit Results:

* The number of votes cast in this election was 369,711
* Number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct
    * Jefferson: 38,855 votes (10.5%)
    * Denver: 306,055 votes (82.8%)
    * Arapahoe: 24,801 votes (6.7%)
* The highest number of votes was obtained by Denver with 306,055 votes.
* Below is the breakdown of the votes obtained by each candidate.
     ______________________________________________________________
               CANDIDATO         |  NUMBER OF VOTES |   PERCENTAGE         
     1. Charles Casper Stockham         38,855             10.5%
     2. Diana DaGette                  272,892             73.8%
     3. Raymond Anthony Doane           11,606             3.1%

    
## Election-Audit Summary:

As shown in the previous point, where it can be validated that the data that was requested is present, the development carried out in Python meets all the requirements for it to be a tool that can be used, it has many benefits, since it It will allow in less time to obtain the information they need in less time and with the certainty that the result obtained from the programming is reliable.

The development is completely commented and structured to make changes in which it can be adapted to the needs that arise in the future.

Below I will give you two examples of how, through simple modifications in the code developed in Python, it can be adapted to other types of elections.

### Suggested modifications to adapt the script to another audit election

The way in which the information is extracted is through a file separated by commas, where the information is audited and the relevant data of an election is obtained. The developed code allows to carry out, through a change in it, the change of the name of the file, that is, making a modification in the line of code to adapt it to the new data provided and in a matter of seconds to obtain the audit of them.

1. Modify the name of the file from which the information will be obtained

In line 9 of the developed script, the name of the file where the information will be obtained to perform the analysis of the information is indicated. As shown in image #1, it is at this point that the name of the file with the CSV extension must be changed.

2. Modify the name file where the analysis data to be audited will be obtained.

In line 11 of the script developed in Python, we can modify the file that we will obtain once the tool is executed, it is important to mention that the file can remain the same, but the information will rewrite the data of the previous analysis, that is why, that it is important to change the file name to ensure that the audited information has a specific file.

Image #2 shows where the file name information that will result once the script is executed should be modified.

## SUMMARY

As has been shown, the benefits of adopting the script developed in Python to automate the process of obtaining data in any type of election are greater than not having it.

Why should I have this script?

1. Reliable information
2. Structured information with data summary
3. Election result in a quick time
